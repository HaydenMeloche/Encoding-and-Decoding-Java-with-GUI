# Encoding-and-Decoding-Java-with-GUI
  My first attempt at GUI. Encodes/Decodes string that user inputs and displays it. 
  
  Uses Jasypt API. Credit to: http://www.jasypt.org/
 
  To install API: Copy everything in modules folder to Netbeans/apisupport/modules.
 
  Thanks to Ryan Guarasica for the help. https://github.com/rguarascia
